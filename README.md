# Ik Project

### Single person project
### Duration: 3 weeks

## Project details:
We were tasked with making a website that has a Content Management System using our knowledge we gained from the past 1.5 month.
I wanted to create my own CMS in PHP, a language that I haven't used before. Unfortunately, I didn't see the scale of learning PHP in such a short time, so I had to scrap the CMS. Instead, I opted to focus all my knowledge I had onto the website and make it as appealing as I could.

## Project setup:

You can just download the 'ik_project' folder onto your webhost and then visit it's index.php.
