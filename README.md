# Ik Project

# Single person project
# Duration: 3 weeks

## Project details:
We were tasked with making a website that has a Content Management System using our knowledge we gained from the past 1.5 month.
I wanted to create my own CMS in PHP, a language that I haven't used before. Unfortunately, I didn't see the scale of learning PHP in such a short time, so I had to scrap the CMS. Instead, I opted to focus all my knowledge I had onto the website and make it as appealing as I could.

## Project setup:

The 'index.php' file needs to be in the root webserver folder, the 'ik_project' folder will be in the root as well.
